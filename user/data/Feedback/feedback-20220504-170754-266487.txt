Feedback or Comments: Let me introduce you to Nutritional Products International, a global brand management company based in Boca Raton, FL, which helps domestic and international health and wellness companies launch products in the U.S.

As senior account executive for business development at NPI, I work with many health and wellness brands that are seeking to enter the U.S. market or expand their sales in America.

After researching your brand and product line, I would like to discuss how we can expand your penetration in the worldâ€™s largest consumer market.

At NPI, we work hard to make product launches as easy and smooth as possible. We are a one-stop, turnkey approach.

For many brands, we become their U.S. headquarters because we offer all the services they need to sell products in America. NPI provides sales, logistics, regulatory compliance, and marketing expertise to our clients.

We import, distribute, and promote your products.

NPI for more than a decade has helped large and small health and wellness brands bring their products to the U.S. NPI is your fast track to the retail market.
