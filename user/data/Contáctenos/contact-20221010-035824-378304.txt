Mensaje: Dear all,

    We get in touch with you from TV3, the national television in Catalonia, based in Barcelona, for "Temps de Neu", the pioneering snow sports tv show, weekly on air for the past 37 winter seasons.

Next December the 8th, we are lauching a new season with a brand new section about international ski resorts, an accurate selection of some of the best ski areas in the world, according to our thoughts.

You are one of those selected to be shown to our audience, and that's why we would like to know if you would be so kind to provide us with some footage of your ski area, in broadcast quality. Promotional images, aerial and extra footage will be fine. And If you wish,  explanations, comments or specific items you would like us to talk about, will be wellcome as well.

Please, be free to take a look at our website and social media to get an idea of what we are talking about.
