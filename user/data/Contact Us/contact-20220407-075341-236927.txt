Question and Comments: Many companies are known for their product development. That is their expertise.

As senior account executive for business development at Nutritional Products International, I have worked with brands that have created and developed innovative products that consumers would want to buy.

But these companies don’t have the staff or knowledge to successfully launch their products in the U.S. This is why many domestic and international health and wellness brands reach out to NPI.

Launching products in the U.S. is our expertise.

On a daily basis, I research companies in the health and wellness sectors, which is how I came across your brand.

NPI, a global brand management company based in Boca Raton, FL., can help you.

Through a one-stop, turnkey platform called the “Evolution of Distribution,” NPI gives you all the expertise and services you need when you launch your product line here. We become your headquarters in the United States.

What does NPI do? We import, distribute, and market your product line.

When you work with NPI, you don’t need to hire a U.S. sales and support team or contract with a high-priced Madison Avenue marketing agency.

NPI, along with its sister company, InHealth Media, collaboratively work to market your products to consumers and retailers throughout the U.S.

Respectfully,

Mark
