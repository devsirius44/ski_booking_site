Question and Comments: I am Nayan (27) from Hyderabad, India and am planning to skii with a small group of my cousins (overall 2-4 pax) in Gulmarg and came across your Beginner package. I do have some experience skiing but the rest of us are beginners. I liked the Beginner package with Shaw Inn stay as it was around our planned budget. Can you help me with the discounts and any additional information would be appreciated.


How many people travelling together? 2-4
How many people skiing? 2-4
Your level of skiing? Beginner, intermediate or advanced? Largely beginner
What level of comfort you are looking for? Above basic, but not too expensive. (Something like the Shaw Inn package would be perfect)
Arrival and departure dates. â€‹ Tentatively in the last 10 days of January.
