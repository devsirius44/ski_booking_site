I am currently at 402 different mountains from around the globe and I am trying to get to 1,000.\n\nI would love to have a\_map\_for Gulmarg. I don't have any maps for India, The Guinness\_Book of World Records approved rules state that it must be the official printed map from the resort to be valid. Could you please forward my request to the appropriate person(s) to mail me a\_trail\_map? Alpine or nordic or both.\nMy address is:\nBen Bedard\n2162 E County Line Rd\nArdmore PA 19003 USA\n\np.s. if you could include a sticker or postcard, my twelve-year-old daughter would love it!"
