Question and Comments: I'm interested in part-time or high-season casual employment at Gulmarg teaching skiing. I have been teaching and coaching skiing for 18 years, mostly in British Columbia Canada. I am a Level 3 CSIA instructor with my Level 1 course conductor certificate, Snowpack coach and Avalanche Safety Training Level 2.

Thank you,
-Andres
