Question and Comments: Hello, I&#039;m planning a trip to go snowboarding in Gulmarg in the month of February and am reaching out to get some help in planning my trip. 

Q1. How many people travelling together? at most 2 people
Q2. How many people skiing? 2 people
Q3. Your level of skiing? Beginner, intermediate or advanced? Beginner 
Q4. What level of comfort you are looking for? Not entirely sure I follow the question; I&#039;d say mid to upper levels of comfort. Might help if we can get more context on the question.
Q5. Arrival and departure dates. â€‹Tentatively 13th to 20th Feb
Q6. What are the charges to rent snowboarding gear per person?
Q7. What are the charges to hire an instructor to help show us the ropes?

Just want to mention that I&#039;m an Indian National and would prefer to know the rates &amp; charges for accommodation / rental equipment / lift tickets / hiring an instructor in INR instead of CAD.
