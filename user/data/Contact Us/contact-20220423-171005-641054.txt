Question and Comments: Hi

I am writing to you on behalf Giejo Magazine. We have received a substantial number of enquiries asking us to feature skigulmarg.com in our "Business Spotlight" section covering inspirational business stories (not sure if these enquiries were from your PR team or customers).

We would be happy to feature skigulmarg.com in the next month's edition of the magazine.

Here is a bit about the "Business Spolight" section

The purpose of the section is to provide readers with an insight into how the business was started, a story about its founders, their motivations for starting the business, an executive overview of the company and what it does, a review of its products/services, how it compares to other companies in the industry. The piece should be informative rather than promotional. We are interested more in putting the founders/owners in the spotlight and tracking their journey. The purpose of this piece is to inspire people and not to promote products or services.

Please let me know if you are interested. I would appreciate if you could revert to me by the end of the week as we are pretty tight on the deadlines. In your reply, please copy in stories@shopgiejo.com

Kind regards

Ieva Kubiliute
