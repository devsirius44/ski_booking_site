Question and Comments: Hi guys!
We're in the middle of a heat wave here in Western Canada, so it seemed like a good time to start plotting a ski trip...
Single male traveller, 62, good skier, considerable back country experience in Canada's Rockies and Coast mountains, volunteer ski patroller with a lot of avy training. 
My window of opportunity is between Feb 24 to Mar 13 including travel from/to Canada, was looking at a week or 10 days doing resort, back country & heli (if I can afford it).
Not looking for luxury accommodations or anything like that, I usually stay in hostels & huts when skiing.
Little bit preliminary right now, just starting to work on the process, mostly after some guidance & advice at this point.
Cheers,
Peter Gill
