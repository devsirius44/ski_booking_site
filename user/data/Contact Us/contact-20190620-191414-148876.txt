message: "Hi Yanik\r\nGreat website, lots of info. \r\n\r\nI am a canadian mtn  guide pondering a trip to Gulmarg next winter. We would arrive late Jan and plan on 2 weeks ski time. The max group size would be myself plus 4 guests. \r\n\r\nI’ve had a look at your website and am hoping to make this work if we can. I envision using one of your local guides as an organizer / fixer, tail guide, local knowledge etc. We would want to stay in one of the better hotels, maybe the Highland?\r\n\r\nThe big question at this point is the political situation in Kashmir. Obviously none of us can see into the future but I am interested in your opinion of the current situation. \r\n\r\nIndia is not new to me, in the 90’s I guided out of Manali 3 seasons for what was then Himachal Heli Skiing. My guests are all veteran world travellers, not risk adverse but still sensible people, who want to travel somewhere if it make sense. At present the Canadian government has a “avoid all travel” advisory for Kashmir, for what that is worth, although that  does effect me personally somewhat when it comes to things like liability and travel insurance.\r\n\r\nI would expect that the Gulmarg area itself is pretty safe but what is your opinion of the current risks travelling through Srinagar? I know, tough question as it is a volatile area. I watch the news every day and it looks like Kashmir remains pretty tense.\r\n\r\nYour thoughts and insights would help us with our decision.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nYours \r\n\r\nRob Orvig\r\nACMG/IFMGA  Mountain Guide"
