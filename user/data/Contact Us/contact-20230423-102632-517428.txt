Question and Comments: Hi, we are planning a ski trip to India next winter. We would be a small group of 4 to 6 friends, skiers and possibly 2 snowboarders, and I have a few preliminary questions.

What is the best period of the year to find decent amounts of powder?

 What is the typical duration of a stay ?

 Can you provide preliminary details: transportation from Delhi, accommodation,...

Thank you.

Francois
