Question and Comments: Hi there - I am interested in booking with you for 2-4 nights from 24th or 25th March this year. I would like to stay at either The Shaw Inn or The Rosewood (or somewhere of similar standard and price). My wife has ski'd a few times but lacks confidence so would be happy with beginner/improver lessons and slopes. I snowboard and would love to try out some powder. We would need equipment. Your packages are interesting and I like that they include everything including airport transfer and even the last night houseboat package (although would like to see images to check the standard).

This is part of a longer 6 week trip we are doing in India coming from the UK and this will be our second stop after Mumbai - consequently I don't want to spend too much but we are also in our 40's so looking for a reasonable level of comfort and standard.

Anyway, appreciate if you can help with these dates and the different needs of myself (reasonably experienced snowboarder) and my wife (improver skier).

Thanks!

Noel
