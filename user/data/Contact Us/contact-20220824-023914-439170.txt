Question and Comments: Hello.  I am interested i a trip to Gulmarg for myself  (49 male ex canada instructor)  amd my 14 year old son. We are both expert skiers having just done a 28 day road trip through Canada in Jan 22. Whistler Rev, Kicking Horse, Sunshine and the Lake.  We loved Kicking Horse and The Dive at Sunshine and are after that kind of double black skiing and steep pow and dont mind a bit of hiking and adventure.  Is this the type of thing you get at Gulmarg?  Do your guides take clients outside the ski area boundary?  What is the best time of year and how many days do you need?  We are thinking Jan 2023 for at least 14 days skiing.   Thanks Tim
