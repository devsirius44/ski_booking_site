My questions -
1. I would like to book the beginner package with accommodation at the Hotel Shaw Inn for the above dates. I would like to pay in INR. What is the best discounted rate you can offer?
2. As a beginner, what can I expect for the 5 ski days? Will the first few days be at the beginner slopes at the base? Are 5 days enough to learn enough and do a few runs from Phase 1?
3. Can harsh weather conditions affect the base and Phase 1 as well? Or is it only Phase 2 that gets affected?
4. What should I pack? Your website says that all ski gear and warm clothing will be provided. Anything that is excluded? Is the ski gear provided on a daily basis (rent in the morning, return in the evening)? Or is it for the entire duration?
