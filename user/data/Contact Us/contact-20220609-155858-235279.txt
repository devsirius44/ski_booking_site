Question and Comments: Hi,

My brother and I would be interested in 4-5 days backcountry guiding, 1 day of heliboarding, and a day to become accustomed to the altitude. We are both advanced snowboarders. 

We are looking for midrange comfort.

The dates we are available is Feb 11th-18th 2023.

How much would it cost? 
Do you have availability?

Thanks
Nick
