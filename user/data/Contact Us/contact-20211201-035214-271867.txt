Question and Comments: Hey there! I would love to learn how to ski at your resort! I have never tried it before so could you please suggest me if January is a good time for beginners to learn? I read that it may not be great conditions as there would be just a little snowfall. Please advise. 

Here is the other info as requested:

How many people travelling together? 2 people
How many people skiing? 2 people
Your level of skiing? Beginner, intermediate or advanced? Beginner
What level of comfort you are looking for? Basic - would like to know the most affordable/ cost-effective package
Arrival and departure dates. â€‹- Tentative is January 3 - January 10 (Are there dates that more premium than others?)

It would be great if I could jump on a quick call with someone too if possible. I can be reached on +919819965458 (on WhatsApp too). Looking forward to your response. Thank you!

Regards,
Vidhi
