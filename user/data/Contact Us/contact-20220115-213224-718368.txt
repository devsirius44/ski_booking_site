Question and Comments: Hi there,

We are hoping to get some more information about coming to Gulmarg between 19th-26th February. We are a group of 6-11 (depending on quotes etc) of varying ability with some total beginners and some intermediate-advanced skiers (about 4 of us). We are currently living and working in Kathmandu so would fly via Delhi on Sat 19th.

Are you able to provide more information on options/costs/accommodation for the group? Probably at least middle comfort upwards for accommodation. 

We would also all need ski equipment hire, is there decent (ish) kit including helmets available?

Many thanks in advance! Also happy to arrange a skype chat at some point if this is easier too, as we'll be on similar timezones.

Em
