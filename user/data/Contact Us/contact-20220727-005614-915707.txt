Greetings,

As inflation rises, small business owners are particularly hard hit.

Is it okay if I post an article on your website explaining how small businesses can manage their finances in the face of inflation?

In order to help small businesses that have already been affected by the pandemic survive these tough times, the information offered is my goal.

I appreciate your consideration.

Kayla Rowe
