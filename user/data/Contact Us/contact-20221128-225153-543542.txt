Question and Comments: Hi, 
I am hoping to book a week in February snowboarding in Gulmarg and was looking at the Comfort and Economic Packages. I would be travelling on my own and am an Intermediate snowboarder (can get down most things - working on carving and steeps). 

My schedule is pretty flexible, I wanted to ask what are the best dates in feb to avoid crowds(do I need to worry about crowds?) and if I book a package can I guarantee my own room?

Flights at the moment are also flexible, I would be flying air India with a 3 hour transit in Delhi, I would be bringing my own gear, I know its very hard to plan but is luggage lost or delayed often in transit? Would I be better spending a day in Delhi rather than transferring straight through?  

Currently looking at arriving in Srinagar on feb 18th and leaving on the 26th. Would you have a suitable package? I was thinking three or 4 guided days would be enough and would optionally add heli boarding depending on weather at the time. 

Thanks and kind regards,
Jamie
