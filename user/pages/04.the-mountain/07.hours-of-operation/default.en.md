#General Info &amp; Hours of Operation — Gulmarg Gondola

###Gulmarg Ski Resort — General Information

Gulmarg Ski Resort's claim to fame is the Gulmarg Gondola, the highest ski lift in the world, ascending to an elevation of 3,980 meters.

Installed by a French company, M/S Pomagalski, Phase 1 of the Gulmarg Gondola was completed in May 1998. That same year, the Government of Jammu and Kashmir established the J&amp;K State Cable Car Corporation to administer the Gulmarg Cable Car Project.

J&amp;K, in conjunction with Pomagalski, completed Phase II of the Gulmarg Gondola in 2005. Phase II opened access to above tree line skiing and 18 bowls.

Gulmarg's expanded terrain offers limitless lines for powder hounds and expert skiers – a unique experience to Ski India that has helped to increase tourism considerably.

For a complete Ski Himalaya experience, a chairlift was inaugurated in September 2011, giving skiers and riders additional lines of untouched powder and challenging runs.
