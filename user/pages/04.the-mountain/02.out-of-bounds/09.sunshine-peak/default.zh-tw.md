#Gulmarg Ski – Out of Bounds – Exploring Sunshine Peak

Exploring Sunshine Peak is a very nice adventure if Ski Touring in Gulmarg is not enough. If you like to ski tour and snow camp, exploring the Himalayas and Sunshine Peak on skis is a wicked add-on to your Ski Gulmarg trip.

I went twice, and it was unforgettable. I was probably the first snowboarder to ride Sunshine Peak's couloir.

**As Gulmarg Ski Resort is a off-piste, out of bounds ski resort, the health, rescue and evacuation services are not the same as what we are used to. Skigulmarg.com strongly advise to hire a [ski guide](/the-mountain/ski-guides).**

###What We Offer
The Sunshine Ski Touring Program can be adapted to suit your needs. We can help you tailor your Ski India powder adventure by adding a ski touring adventure to Sunshine Peak.

We offer a 3 day / 2 night or 2 day / 1 night Ski Touring Package that includes a Guide, food, sleeping bags, and camping mats.

You will journey to some beautiful and virgin Himalayan terrain away from noise and people. Depending on what you prefer, a shepherd's hut or camping, you will be guided to spend one or more nights under the stars between some of the greatest mountains on Earth.

###The Terrain
The terrain on the way to Sunshine Peak is all Alpine. It's all big-mountain terrain with snowfields, moraines, ridges, peaks, couloirs, and chutes.

It is all very similar to Apharwat but with less trees. The couloirs and chutes end up on a semi-flat plateau. That part is not steep, but it is long so it makes a very long run.

The last bit of terrain that you will ski to get to the creek that leads to Drang is a forest with glades and chutes in the trees.

Skiing down through the trees from Sunshine Peak is beautiful. Some parts are steep while some other parts are not so steep. The trees are massive – it's some of the best tree skiing you will ever do!

###Itinerary Example
Sunshine Peak Touring Itineraries:

One option is to get the first chair up and start making your way down the back of Apharwat.

To reach the creek that separates Gulmarg Ski Resort and the mountains of Sunshine Peak, you will need to ski south on Apharwat. Continue to ski the Southwest end on the ridge, pass over the Southeast and down to the creek. Some parts can be technical.

An experienced local Ski Guide is a must.

The first day you will be walking to reach the Shepherd's Huts or a good location to camp.

If the party is in good physical condition, you might be able to get your camp ready for the night and still have time to ski some nice couloirs – an unforgettable Ski Himalaya experience.

The next day, after skiing Sunshine Peak, you will make your way back down to Drang Village and back to Gulmarg.

Another option is to spend the night at the Top Station of the Gulmarg Gondola.

That way you have an early start in the morning.

These options can be adapted and extended for an action-packed Ski Kashmir adventure.
