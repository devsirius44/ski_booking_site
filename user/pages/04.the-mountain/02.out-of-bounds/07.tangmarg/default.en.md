#Gulmarg Ski – Out of Bounds – To Tangmarg

Even when the Gulmarg Gondola is not running because of storm conditions, there is always some excellent skiing to be found. Skiing down from Gulmarg's plateau at 2,660 meters to Tangmarg is one of many good options when you Ski India.

**As Gulmarg Ski Resort is a off-piste, out of bounds ski resort, the health, rescue and evacuation services are not the same as what we are used to. Skigulmarg.com strongly advise to hire a [ski guide](/the-mountain/ski-guides).**

###Where Do I Go To Ski Down to Tangmarg?
The start of the ski route to Tangmarg is anywhere in between the second entrance to Gulmarg and the Tea House on the corner of the last switchback on the road between Tangmarg and Gulmarg.

An excellent starting point is just to skier's left of the viewpoint between the two entrances to Gulmarg.

###The Best Way To Ski Down to Tangmarg
We advise you to hire a local guide to ski or snowboard down to Tangmarg.

There are several flat areas to be avoided. One more important thing is that there are wires for army communication running through the forest. Local guides know where they are located and know how to ski safely around them.

A taxi will need to be organized by you or your guide. If you don't have a guide, contact a Skigulmarg.com member on location. He or she will be happy to help you.

Once a start zone has been decided, your party will ski down one of many lines you can choose to reach Tangmarg.

There are several flats, and you may have to cross the road that switchbacks up to Gulmarg many times. The ride is lots of fun and a bit longer than the Babarishi trees.

Once in Tangmarg, you will have to wait for the taxi, load it up and drive back up to a new drop zone in Gulmarg.

Pow Pow!

###The Terrain
The terrain is very similar to the Babarishi Trees or Monkey Hill, situated in an awesome mature Pine Tree Forest with big trees and high branches.

The trees are spaced out, and you have lots of room to ski and ride with some decent speed.

The terrain is not too steep in some sections, and it can be harder to find a line where you can keep your speed up all the way. That is one major reason why we recommend a local guide. They know all the best lines when you Ski Kashmir.

As Tangmarg is about 2,100 meters, you will get about 550 vertical meters to enjoy.

Some very nice steeps can be found… Pow Pow! Ski Himalaya!
