If the price increase at 40 days or more prior to the delivery of services has increased by 10% and above since the date the invoice was sent, the participant can cancel the hired or contracted services (with full refund excluding bank transfer fees and handling fees) or opt for a substitute package offering similar services. If the cost of a package offering similar services exceeds those booked initially, the participant agrees to pay the price difference.

No price increase can occur within 30 days of the date that services must be provided. Reduction in prices from a promotion or a decision made by Skigulmarg applies to new bookings only.

###Reservation Recommendation <a id="toc-reservation"></a>
We recommend that you book your stay at least 45 days before your planned departure date.

####Payment <a id="toc-payment"></a>
<!-- As there are lots of bank transfer fees and handling fees, we encourage our participant(s) to pay in full in one payment. We offer a CAD $100 (or more) discount per group if all members pay in full in one payment (per participant or group). This $100 discount is offered only if the total payment is made more than 30 days before the start of your Skigulmarg Package. Deposit, payment and cancellation policies will apply the same way if you pay in two or more payments. Conditions may apply. -->

#####Deposit
A minimum of $300 deposit per participant is required at the time of booking. Some hotels require (e.g. Hotel Shaw Inn, Highlands Park, Khyber, etc.) full payment. If the deposit is not paid with the booking, it has to be made within 48 hours of receipt of invoice. No reservations are confirmed until the deposit is received. If Skigulmarg is booking plane tickets for you, 100% of the cost must be paid on receipt of the invoice. No flight reservations are confirmed until the funds are received. 100% of your package total needs to be paid 60 days prior to your package's start date.

#####Final Payment
The balance or pending payment must be received at least 60 days prior to your package's start date; else Skigulmarg reserves the right to cancel the booking without notice and apply the cancellation fee, without recourse by the participant. For bookings made 60 days or less prior to the departure date, payment in full is due at time of reservation.

#####Late Payment
If payments are not made within the stated due date, Skigulmarg is entitled to decline the provision of services and to charge the cancellation fees (see below). Interest could be charged following the: “The Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998.”

#####Payment by bank transfer, credit Card or PayPal
Skigulmarg is a small company; we are working on getting an online payment processing system in place. For now we offer only 2 payment options:

**Our preferred method of payment is with a credit card via Stripe/Paypal.com.**

#####Bank transfer
Skigulmarg offers different options for bank transfer. Our preferred option is bank transfer to our bank account in Taiwan. It is also possible to transfer to our bank account in Gulmarg or our bank account in Quebec.

**IMPORTANT!** For bank transfer, the participant must pay all bank fees, transfer fees, etc. Please make sure you inform your bank to opt for «All charges are borne by the remitter» when sending or transferring your payment (money).

Skigulmarg might ask the participant to provide a written approval to the effect that the credit card could be used without his/her signature.

###Single Room Occupancy Surcharge <a id="toc-single"></a>
Most accommodations we work with offer only double rooms or larger and charge us for single occupancy accordingly. Hence, groups traveling in uneven numbers and solo participants will be charged extra as stated in our packages.

###Special Requests for Hotel <a id="toc-special"></a>
All specific requests such as location of rooms, bedding, etc. have to be made at the time of booking. Skigulmarg will forward your preferences to the hotel but will not guarantee that they will be accepted or complied with by the hotel. Skigulmarg is not responsible if certain requests are not met.

###Airfare, plane tickets and air travel terms <a id="toc-plane"></a>
All Airfare and Plane Tickets need to be paid in full upon receipt of the invoice. No Airline reservations will be confirmed until receipt of the full payment of the airfare. If there is an increase in airfare between the time that the invoice was sent and the receipt of the full payment of the airfare, the difference will be due to Skigulmarg. If the difference is not paid by the participant, Skigulmarg reserves its exclusive right to cancel your package and apply the cancellation fees.

####Changes
Flights are reserved as per the carrier's tariff. In accordance with the airline's tariff, whenever and without notice, flights could be subject to consolidation and may be subject to changes in schedule, airplane type, days of operation, re-routing or change in airline partners. As Skigumarg has no control over this possibility of change and is therefore not responsible or liable to the participant of any such actions, Skigulmarg strongly recommends that participant be aware for this possibility and plan ahead to avoid inconveniences.

####Checking and connecting flights
Flight times, even if printed on a ticket, are for reference only. These can be revised for various reasons, often beyond the control of the airline or Skigulmarg. It is the obligation of all participants who bought a package or a flight with Skigulmarg to confirm the flight departure time at least 24 hours prior to their departure as well as the return flight with all the airline(s) concerned. All bookings including connecting flights are done at the customer’s own risk and the customer has to allow his/herself plenty of time to make any connections. Skigulmarg shall not be held liable in case of a change of schedule or a missed connection, which includes any direct or indirect damage or expenses arising (including, and without limitation, a loss of revenue or earnings, lost vacation days or additional costs incurred).

####Airport check-in
Skigulmarg advises all travelers to arrive at the airport registration desk at least 3 hours before departure. A delayed arrival may lead to the loss of the passenger’s reservation and their seat could be allocated to another customer without possibility of recourse.

####Baggage
Every airline has precise standards for the number, weight and size of baggage. All Participants should check with their chosen airline to verify the policies.

####Other conditions and limitations of airline liability
The conditions of air transportation and claims regarding loss and/or damage to baggage is regulated by the Montreal Convention or the Warsaw Convention, whichever the situation, the applicable tariff by the airline, the contract terms declared on the ticket, boarding pass or baggage receipt and any authorities that establish the limitations of the carrier’s liability. When submitted and approved by governmental authorities, any amendments or changes to these general conditions of carriage can be applied immediately without notice. Airline tickets that are unused, in whole or in part, on the indicated dates will not be honored on other flight or refunded to the customer.

####Seat assignment
Unless you have pre-selected or purchased a specific seat, the agent at the airline counter allocates the seats in the aircraft at the airport. Some extra fees can be charged directly by the airlines for seat preference and are not included in package prices.

###Cancellation Policy and Fees <a id="toc-cancellation"></a>
All cancellations have to be communicated to Skigulmarg by email and with a registered letter. Received travel documentation must be sent back to Skigulmarg at the time of such cancellation.

Cancellation fees will be charged by Skigulmarg in every case of cancellation made at the traveler’s request - whatever the cause, which includes, but is not limited to: fear of political unrest, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, acts of God, or any personal reason.

Further claims for compensation are excluded.

Skigulmarg could cancel a participant or group’s package in the case of a change in a participant’s medical condition or fitness.
