#What to do? — Things to do in Gulmarg

Skiing Gulmarg is a lot of fun but there are other things besides skiing while visiting Gulmarg. Some restaurants are worth a visit. You might want to take a day off and just take pictures of Religious sites or shop for souvenirs.

###Après-Ski and Nightlife
Gulmarg cannot compare with Whistler or Chamonix for Après-ski and Nightlife, but there is always a good vibe and a fun time is easy to find.
