###Delhi and Mumbai Airports

Indira Gandhi International Airport is the primary international airport of the National Capital Region of Delhi, India.  Named after the former Prime Minister of India, it is the busiest airport in India and serves as a transportation hub for India and South Asia.

The Delhi Airport Metro Express provides rail service to the New Delhi rail station, and the trip takes about 20 minutes. You can also take a bus operated by DTC or a metered taxi into the city center.

Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (formerly Sahar International Airport) is the primary international airport in Mumbai (formerly Bombay).  The airport is named after the 17th century Emperor, Chhatrapati Shivaji Bhosle.  It serves as India's and South Asia's largest and most important airline hub.  Both airports handle more than half of the air traffic in South Asia.

The best way to get into Mumbai (Colaba) is by taking a prepaid taxi from the front of the international arrivals area. It should take about 1 Â½ to 2 hours to get to the city center, but travel time is much less in the early morning or late evening when traffic is lighter.
