#From Srinagar Airport To Gulmarg.

Srinagar Airport is 52 kilometers from the Village of Gulmarg. Transport to Gulmarg can take anywhere from 1 ½ hours to over 3 hours. The most time-consuming part of the journey is getting out of Srinagar and the last 12 kilometers along a mountain road that brings you to Gulmarg Ski Resort to start your Ski Himalaya adventure.

Once you reach Tangmarg (the last village before Gulmarg), the road turns into a series of switchbacks that go from 1800 meters to 2660 meters. During the winter, road conditions can be quite interesting. Busses get stuck and Indian or Kashmiri tourists try to go up the mountain road with only summer tires on their cars – this can make the process very funny and frustrating at the same time!

###From the Airport to Gulmarg with Skigulmarg.com

We provide taxi shuttle service from Srinagar Airport to Gulmarg. During the winter, tire chains are needed almost every day. All of our taxis carry chains. If you book a taxi with us, we will be waiting for you as you exit the airport. It will take about 5 minutes to secure your gear on the roof and in our truck before departing to begin your exotic adventure into the Himalayan Mountains of Kashmir.

This is the easiest and most hassle-free way to get to Gulmarg. As we'll have your flight number and arrival time, we'll be there to greet you on time to welcome you to paradise.

####The Cheaper Way

A cheaper way to get to Gulmarg is to try and find a taxi by yourself at the airport exit. Prepaid taxis are available, but the process can be chaotic. Most likely, you will have to change taxis in Tangmarg as most taxis from Srinagar don't carry chains to go up the snowy, winding mountain road.

We recommend booking a taxi in advance to ensure a smoother arrival. You will be able to stop in Srinagar if you need to.

####The Cheapest Way

Getting to Gulmarg by shared taxi is the cheapest way to go. It is very cheap, but expect a long journey. Shared taxis stop every time someone needs to get in or out of the taxi. They run with as many people as they can. They could try to pack up to 10 people plus the driver in a single taxi…

###Last Minute Tips Before You Reach Gulmarg

You may want to stop in Srinagar for a few reasons:

+ It is often hard to make purchases with big bank notes (1000 INR) in Gulmarg. It can be very frustrating when you are in a rush to buy a ski pass because there's tons of powder on the mountain, but the ticket seller looks at you and says: "No change" – and then you can't buy a ticket.
+ Last year, the liquor store in Gulmarg was closed down as it is a Muslim area and they started to sell to underage kids…So, if you feel like having a drink in your room or on your balcony after a sweet day of deep powder riding, it may be a good idea to stop in Srinagar and stock up on liquor supplies. Be ready for a culture shock…
+ We also find it useful to buy a multi-pronged outlet that you can use to connect and charge your electronic devices.

###Getting Around

The best way to get around Gulmarg is on foot. You can walk around all of Gulmarg in about 1 hour on a road that loops around the village. Other options are skiing, skating, taking a sled ride driven by Kashmiri locals or grabbing a tow behind a passing Jeep. If you want to ski into Tangmarg, you can hop on a taxi to get back to Gulmarg.
