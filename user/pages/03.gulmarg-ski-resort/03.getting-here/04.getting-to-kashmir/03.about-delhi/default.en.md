#About Delhi — The First Impression — To do

Delhi can be overwhelming if it's your first time visiting the city. In a city of over 16 million people, you should expect noise, massive crowds, never-ending traffic, and aggressive touts trying to sell their wares. If you can get past all that and manage to dodge the persistent touts, you'll discover that Delhi, India's capital, is a captivating city. It's a city of lush gardens, ancient monuments, interesting museums, a vibrant performing arts community, and some of the tastiest cuisine around.

###Getting Around Delhi

There are various means of transportation in Delhi, and a large majority of the population uses public transportation to commute.

Visitors can travel by Metro Rail (Delhi's rapid transit system), local train, city bus or taxi.

The best way to get around Delhi is by Metro Rail. Traffic congestion in Delhi is pretty bad, and the metro provides a quick, clean, efficient, air-conditioned solution to Delhi's never-ending traffic.

Other options include auto rickshaws and HOHO. Auto rickshaws are distinctive yellow and green 3-wheeled vehicles with no doors. They are less expensive than taxis. Delhi's Hop-On/Hop-Off bus service (HOHO) allows tourists to hop on and hop off at any pick-up/drop-off point. They're air-conditioned and stop at all of the major tourist destinations in Delhi.

###Where to Stay

If you plan on staying in Delhi, there are several areas you may want to consider: lodging near Indira Gandhi International Airport, Paharganj, Khan Market or Connaught Place.

Many skiers fly into Delhi on their way to Ski Himalaya. If you are only staying in Delhi for one night before traveling to Gulmarg Ski Resort, you may want to stay near the airport. One choice is the Hotel Delhi Aerocity, a 3-star budget hotel with 24-hour restaurant service and airport pick-up and drop-off services.

Visitors looking for a central, inexpensive location should consider staying on Paharganj, a street which is also known as the Main Bazaar. It's conveniently located across from the New Delhi Railway Station. The bazaar is popular with backpackers and sells items like Indian perfumes, shawls, rugs, and jewelry.

For more upscale lodging, Khan Market is a popular area with foreign diplomats and Tibetan lamas. The market has a good selection of quality Indian-style clothing, housewares, jewelry, and lots of bookshops.

Connaught Place (now called Rajiv Chowk) is in the heart of New Delhi. Its historic shopping arcade is lined with Western-style shops at reasonable prices. Visitors staying in this area are also close to the Palika Bazaar and other nearby tourist sites like Birla Mandir Temple and Presidential Palace.

###See and Do in Delhi

If you're traveling through Delhi to Ski India and only have one day in the city, be sure to visit the Red Fort. It's a red sandstone fort that was built in 1648 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as his ruling palace. The massive complex contains several buildings. Khas Mahal was the Emperor's main residence and overlooks the Yamuna River. The Sultan's main wife had her own palace, Rang Mahal, while the rest of the Sultan's harem lived in Mumtaz Mahal, a palace with 6 apartments. There's a 1-hour sound and light show that tells the story of India's history every evening.

Humayun's Tomb, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the final resting place of the second Mughal emperor. The red sandstone tomb is a brilliant example of Mughal architecture. It was built in 1562 by Haj Begum, the Persian-born wife of Humayun. The tomb is surrounded by formal gardens.

Walking tours are a great way to see a city. The Footloose in Old Delhi half-day tour of the walled city is a good introduction to India's culture, architecture, cuisine, and chaos.

###Staying Safe & Healthy in Delhi

All travelers should be cautious about what they eat or drink while visiting Delhi. Drink only bottled water, and eat in places where you see lots of people eating. Avoid raw vegetables and unpeeled fruits. Make sure glasses and cutlery are clean. If you are not careful what you eat and drink, you could get food poisoning or dysentery. You don't want to get sick before you go to Gulmarg. Following these precautions will lessen your chances of getting **"Delhi Belly."** Drink plenty of water…

Delhi has its share of scam artists and touts, and tourists often fall prey to their scams. Be aware that some taxi drivers will try to give you unsolicited directions or travel advice. It's wise not to admit that it's your first time to India as scam artists may prey on unsuspecting tourists. It is always the first question they ask… **First time in India???!!!**

Pickpockets are known to be common in Delhi. Make sure you carry your cash, credit cards, and passport in a money belt, and only carry small amounts of cash with you.
