#Gulmarg Village Map

Gulmarg Ski Resort is the perfect destination for your Ski Himalaya vacation. The heavy snowfall and high elevation of the resort makes it a skier's paradise - where you can find untracked lines in a backcountry setting days after a snowstorm.

Gulmarg Hotels offer ski-in, ski-out accommodations and lodging on the Golf course, where guests can ski or take a short walk to the Gulmarg Gondola. If you stay in Gulmarg Village, you'll experience local culture and great Kashmiri cuisine. It's a short taxi ride in the morning to the gondola.
