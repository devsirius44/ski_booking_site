###The Mountain
From the top of the world famous “Gulmarg Gondola”, the mountains provide enough terrain for a lifetime. Let the thrill of riding down big untracked alpine bowls and mature forest overcome you and let the feeling set you free.

###The Village
The Gulmarg Village is defined by its authenticity at the foot of Mt-Apharwat. The plateau is set at about 2680 meters. Walking around the village, the view on the himalaya is omnipresent. The vibe is relax but true. Take your time, enjoy a local drink or a great meal.

			<h3 class="p-t-20">January - Week 1, 2, 3</h3>
			<p>
				We recommend coming to ski Gulmarg not before the last week of January. The Resort officially start accepting riders on the “Gondola” on January 1st with the start of the contract if the Snow Safety Officer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want to visit Gulmarg during before the last week of January, we recommend keeping an eye on the weather and snow conditions, wait, see, and book at the last minute. We can have everything ready for your arrival in less that 2 days. 
			</p>
			<h3>January - Week 4</h3>
			<p>
				Late January can be excellent. Since my first winter season in 2007-2008, around that time, Gulmarg got hit by a major snowstorm that left lots of snow and great skiing. We never know what Mother Nature will bring us.
			</p>
			<p>
				“La Nina” winters usually bring an early start to the riding season in Gulmarg.  
			</p>
			<p>
				February is the winter high season in Gulmarg. It is when the snow is the deepest and often the most stable snowpack.
			</p>
			<p>
				We recommend booking early if you plan to ski Gulmarg in February.  Good hotels and good guides are highly praised. Availabilities can be a major problem as the number of great ski guides is limited
			</p>
			<p>
				Gulmarg ski season is very short.  By the end of February, it can get quite warm in the village.  The snow on lower elevation or south faces can get sticky.

            	March Can be an excellent month to ride Gulmarg. We recommend skiing Gulmarg before mid-March.
