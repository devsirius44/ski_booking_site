#Gulmarg Weather

During the winter months (December to March), the Pir Panjal mountain range receives heavy snowfall while rain is common in the Kashmir Valley. This weather pattern is due to winds originating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.

Gulmarg's Climate is similar to the European Alps. You can expect the temperature to be around the same as a European ski resort. The only difference (and a good one) is that annual snowfall levels in Gulmarg Ski Resort are roughly double the levels of European resorts. A great reason to Ski Himalaya!

###The Weather Pattern: Gulmarg, the Pir Panjals, the Himalayas – How Will it Affect Your Ski Vacation?
In the winter, strong humid winds originating in the Mediterranean Sea cross over Iran and Afghanistan, drawing humidity from the Indus River, and flow down to the west side of the Pir Panjal and Himalaya mountain ranges. These prevailing winds are southerly so are favorable to the northerly aspect.

When the jet stream moves south of the Himalayas, these strong winds are pushed up the mountains. The rapid rise of air is very fast and strong, thereby condensing the humidity contained in the air mass at an accelerated pace.

The western Himalayas are a configured chain of different mountain ranges. There is a large scale weather system, known as **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Disturbance" target="_blank">Western Disturbance</a>** or WD. The first mountain chain to interact with WD is the Pir Pinjals. As Gulmarg and Mt. Apharwat are situated on the westernmost part of the Himalayas and the Pir Panjals, they are the first to get hit and receive most of that humidity that needs to come down. Gulmarg is at 2,660 meters and Mt. Apharwat's summit is at 4,124 meters… Lots of Fresh Snow falls every winter… Pow Pow!

It actually snowed 232 cm on January 2-3, 2006! Another great reason to Ski India…

A typical winter weather pattern in Gulmarg is characterized by intense storms followed by periods of more stable weather, including light wind and mild temperatures. During all of these weather events, you can find ideal snow conditions somewhere on the mountain.

###Gulmarg Climate
The climate in the Kashmir Valley can be defined as moderate, especially compared to other parts of India. It is generally cool in the spring and fall, mild in the summer (with little rain), and cold in the winter. The weather is always cooler in the hilly areas, like Gulmarg.

Gulmarg Weather patterns are unpredictable. As the elevation changes, so does the climate.
