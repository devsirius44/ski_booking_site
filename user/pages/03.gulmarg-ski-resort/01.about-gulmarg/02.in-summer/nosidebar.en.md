As you may guess from our name (Skigulmarg), we are experts regarding everything related to ski, skiing, snow and snowboarding in Gulmarg. That said, Gulmarg is a great destination all year round and one of the best touristic places in Kashmir. There are lots of great things to experience and activities to do during spring, summer and fall.   

<!-- ###The Mountains
Beautiful meadows, astonishing vistas all around Gulmarg, the top of Mt-Apharwat and the Gulmarg Cable Car; and amazing lakes atop the Himalayas. The Kashmiri region has enough beauty for every type of adventurer!

			<h4 class="p-t-20">APRIL TO JUNE:</h4>
			<p>
				From April onward, winter is officially over and temperatures start to rise. The Himalayas remain colder than the rest of India but daily temperature gets warmer. Average precipitation in April is around 85 mm and Gulmarg´s temperature in April average 14.2 ℃.
			</p>
			<p>
				Average precipitation in May is around 68 mm and Gulmarg´s temperature in May average 17.7 ℃. By June precipitation averages only 39 mm. The temperature in Gulmarg in June can reach an all-time high of 37 ℃ and averages 22 ℃
			</p>
			<p>
				April and May get more rain. We recommend activities that are not too off-the-beaten-track. During these months, we recommend coming to Gulmarg to play Golf (Gulmarg has the highest golf course in the world), ride an ATV or the Gulmarg Cable Car (Gulmarg Gondola); if you have children, take them on a traditional pony ride surrounded by the mighty Himalayas.
			</p>
			<p>
				“June is not as wet or hot as the summer months. A good time to be in Gulmarg. A great time to take a ride on the Gulmarg Cable Car (Gulmarg Gondola) as there will still be some snow...

        </div>
        <div class="p-0">
            <h4 class="p-t-20">JULY AND AUGUST:</h4>
            <p>
            	July and August are the summer months in Gulmarg. Temperatures are the highest; averaging 23 ℃. Average precipitation in Gulmarg is about 62 mm and 76 mm. This allows for some nice trekking options. The ice on mountain lakes melt away and people who dare to hike up can be granted with some paradisiac vistas and rather comfortable weather conditions..
            </p>
            <p>
                The best activity during this time is the Kashmir Great Lakes Trek a 10 Nights / 11 Days. One of India's trekking gems! Be mindful that although Gulmarg´s weather in August is comfortable, you will still be going up high mountains. Bringing appropriate clothing and keep an eye on the weather. High mountain weather can change quickly.

        </div>
        <div class="p-0">
            <h4 class="p-t-20">SEPTEMBER TO NOVEMBER:</h4>
            <p>
            	Fall is a great time to visit Gulmarg and Kashmir. Winter is approaching. While powder hounds start getting itchy feet, it is still not the time to ski. Until November the weather in Gulmarg and Kashmir is very comfortable. Precipitations are at their lowest. Perfect for an incredible hike.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Gulmarg´s temperature in September averages 20 ℃ and precipitation 31 mm. Gulmarg´s temperature in October averages 14 ℃ and precipitation 33 mm. Gulmarg´s temperature in November averages 8 ℃ and precipitation 38 mm.
            </p>
            <p>
            	September is still a very good time to go on the Great Lakes Trek. For October and November, we offer 2 superb treks around Gulmarg. For families with children, we recommend the 3 nights / 4 days trek. In the more adventurous, we recommend the 5 nights / 6 days trek.

          <h5>What about food?</h5>

          <ul>
          <li>Tell us of any dietery requirements before booking so we can confirm availability during the treks. Be sure to let us know about any food allergies or allergies in general when you book a package.</li>

          <li>Even though we provide basic first aid kits be sure to carry your own set of painkiller, allergy medication, blister bands, etc.</li>

          <li>Avoid overexertion. The treks take place at quite a high altitude and it takes a while to get acclimated. Follow your guide and respect the pace. Don´t drink alcohol or join the trip if you suffer from cardiac disease or any similarly debilitating condition.</li>

          <h5>Money Requirements</h5>

          <p>All main meals are provided during the trip but you may want to bring some cash in order to buy drinks or snacks while on the way. Tipping is customary but up to you to decide the amount if you decide to tip. Avoid giving money or gifts to children on the trails for cultural reasons.</p>

          <h5>Taking pictures and video</h5>

          <p>If you want to photograph a person be sure to ask them first. Respect their right to refuse and if you take the picture with a digital camera or phone be sure to show them the picture and erase it if asked to do so.</p>

          <h5>Respect the environment</h5>
          <ul>
          <li>We support clean and environment friendly tourism so be careful not to contaminate, damage or destroy the landscape, harming animals or disrespecting the people.</li>

          <li>Try not to contaminate water streams, burn any toilet paper used to avoid contamination, bury your feces and be sure to do your necessities at least 50 meters away from water to not harm local wildlife.</li>

          <li>Remember that you are a guest, which means that you need to respect the local traditions and ways. Be open to the new culture that you will be experiencing and you will be surprised at how much you can learn and enjoy during the trip. Dress appropriately and respect holy places.</li>

            Our great lakes trek  is not for the faint of heart. It offers the greatest views and the most challenges as it consists of 11 days of trekking up and down the Kashmiri mountain, visiting the best places in Jammu and Kashmir, seeing waterfalls, lakes, forests and snow covered peaks, including the world famous <a href="https://vagabondimages.in/2018/01/27/a-tale-of-seven-lakes-gadsar-to-satsar/"target="_ blank">Satsar Lake</a>; a beautiful series of 7 interconnected lakes in a cascade formation. Ending with a relaxing tour of the floating market in  Dal Lake.</p>

            <p>
            The high altitude and demanding nature of the trip makes it unsuitable for children. If you wish to go trekking with children please consider our other packages.

###Play Golf in Gulmarg

This 72 par course is quite challenging with its many slopes and inclines. You can rent equipment and play at any time, but it remains covered in snow until late April, so plan ahead.
