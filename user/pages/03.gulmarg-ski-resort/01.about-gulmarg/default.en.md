Gulmarg is a small village in the Pir Panjal peaks of India, located at the extreme western edge of 1 of the 6 mountain ranges that form the Himalayan Mountains. Gulmarg was established as a ski resort in 1927 by two British Army officers but was originally a hill station for wealthy tourists looking to beat the summer heat. It was a favorite vacation spot for Mughal kings and later for the British elite during their Indian occupancy.
