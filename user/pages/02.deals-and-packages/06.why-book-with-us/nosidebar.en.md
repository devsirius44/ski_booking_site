#Why Travel With Skigulmarg.com?

O.k., so you're ready to book your Ski Himalaya vacation. You want your vacation to be a memorable one, with memories that will last a lifetime. But you also want it to be hassle free.

Traveling to an unfamiliar country can be overwhelming, and that's why it's best to leave the planning in the hands of a professional tour operator. But how do you choose the best tour operator – the one with the most knowledge who will give you the best value for your hard-earned money?

###Here are 5 reasons why you should book a tour with us:

1. Ski Industry Knowledge – The founder of Skigulmarg.com, Yanik Turgeon, has a solid background in the ski industry. Yanik, an avid snowboarder, started selling ski trips when he was a 15-year-old high school student in Quebec. Eventually, Yanik made his way to Gulmarg and was so impressed with its exceptional skiing that he's been there since the 2007-2008 ski season. He understands how the ski industry works in Gulmarg, India and started selling ski tour packages during the 2009-2010 ski season. He uses his passion and knowledge to put together the best tour package for his customers.

2. Local Knowledge – A tour operator who is sitting at a desk somewhere far away from Gulmarg cannot truly understand the difficult situations and mishaps that can arise in a Himalayan ski resort. Yanik understands those challenges and uses that knowledge to provide a better experience for his guests. Yanik understands the ins and outs of the Kashmiri culture and people and has made some strong contacts with the locals. Because of his local contacts, he can offer more quality service.

3. Strong Relationships with the Local Ski Guides – Having skied Gulmarg since the 2007-2008 ski season, Yanik has built strong relationships with the local ski guides and will only recommend the most qualified guides. These top guides will ensure your safety while skiing the backcountry terrain of Gulmarg and will also make sure that you have the best possible ski experience. They'll take you to the secret spots and powder stashes that only local guides can find.

4. All-inclusive packages: All of our tour packages are all-inclusive, allowing for a hassle-free experience. We offer the best value for your money. Tour packages include transportation from Srinagar airport, accommodations, ski lift tickets, and a qualified ski guide. Our packages are also very flexible; we will adapt them to suit your needs.

5. Reasonable, Affordable Prices - At Skigulmarg.com, we strive to give you an exceptional level of service at the most reasonable prices. We offer a various range of packages – all at an affordable price. Because of our local contacts, we are able to offer the best prices available for whatever comfort level package you choose.
