#Gulmarg Hotels on the Golf Course

One more option, a little farther away than Ski in - Ski out Hotels but closer than staying in the Village. A stay on the golf course offers a great view of the mountain, luxury in Gulmarg's most historic hotels, and great atmosphere.

##Staying on the Golf Course

###East of Gulmarg Gondola
There are 2 Gulmarg Hotel options if you want to stay on the Golf Course. Both hotels are part of Gulmarg's history and offer luxury stays.

+ Hotel Highlands Park [Book Now](https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=1&cid=1650708&hl=en&hid=5235643&target=_blank&classes=lodging-button)
+ Nedous Hotel Gulmarg [Book Now](https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=1&cid=1650708&hl=en&hid=300390&target=_blank&classes=lodging-button)

Staying on the Golf Course ensures a great view on Mt. Apharwat and the Pir Panjal Range. You can also see the Great Himalaya Range on the other side of the Valley of Kashmir.

It is also a good option for families, as both of those hotels are situated just beside the surface lifts of the hilly golf course which is perfect for kids and beginners.

While staying on the Golf Course in one of those options, you will be about 800 meters from the base of the Gondola. From there, you could ski down, then walk to the gondola -- a 500 meter walk.

###South of the Gondola
There is one more hotel option in Gulmarg that can be considered on the Golf Course and is almost a ski-in, ski-out option.

+ Hill Top Hotel Gulmarg [Book Now](https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=1&cid=1650708&hl=en&hid=2085900&target=_blank&classes=lodging-button)

This hotel is situated about 100 meters from the base station of the road to Gulmarg Gondola.

It has 2 restaurants and o.k. rooms. We consider the hotel to be pretty expensive for the level of comfort, but the hotel is very well situated.
