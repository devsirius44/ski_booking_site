#Srinagar — Ski Himalaya Adventure

You've travelled all the way to India to Ski Himalaya – a trip of a lifetime for most skiers and riders. Besides skiing at Gulmarg Ski Resort, you'll want to see as much as you can of the surrounding area and experience the local culture. Spending a night or 2 in Srinagar will give you a sense of the Kashmiri culture, and you'll get to see the beautiful lakes and gardens in the "Venice of the East."

##A Night or Two in Srinagar on Your Ski Himalaya Adventure

###A Classic: Dal Lake Srinagar Houseboat <a href="https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=1&cid=1650708&hl=en&hid=568522" target="_blank" class="btn btn-rounded" style="margin-left:20px">Book Now</a> 
Srinagar's Dal Lake is lined with thousands of houseboats, made of local cedar wood and lavishly decorated with intricate wood carvings. You can rent these houseboats -- staying on one of these "floating palaces" is a unique experience that you won't want to miss.

Houseboats come in various levels of luxury and sizes, and all have balconies to enjoy views of the Himalayan Mountains.

Wooden taxi boats, known as shikaras, can take you along the winding waterways of Dal Lake and to the floating vegetable markets.

Our all-inclusive packages include a stay on a houseboat at no extra charge, meaning that you have the option to stay on a houseboat for as many nights as you like instead of staying at your Gulmarg hotel.

Another option is to book a trip that includes a houseboat stay and sightseeing & shopping.

<h3>Staying in a Hotel <a href="https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=1&cid=1650708&hl=en&city=10188" target="_blank" class="btn btn-rounded" style="margin-left:20px">Book Now</a></h3>
We highly recommend that you stay on a Srinagar houseboat as it is an exceptional experience – it's something that you will remember for a lifetime.

However, if you really prefer staying in a Srinagar Hotel, we can book any type of comfort hotel for your stay in Srinagar.
