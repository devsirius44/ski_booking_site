#Staying in Gulmarg Village

Wherever you decide to stay in Gulmarg, there will be Pros & Cons. Staying in the village of Gulmarg has the inconvenience of being a little far from the Gondola in the morning. But, it offers a lot that other areas in Gulmarg do not.

##Staying in Gulmarg Village

###Pros & Cons - Staying in Gulmarg Village has its advantages:

+ Provides a cheaper option with a range of different comfort levels
+ Cultural experience
+ Closer to the locals and the real people of Gulmarg
+ Accessibility to the bank, taxi, buses, a fruits & vegetable store, and convenience stores (where you can buy cookies, breads, and cakes right out of a wood-fired oven)
+ Cheap authentic Indian restaurants
+ Noisier, dirtier and more chaotic

The only disadvantage of staying in Gulmarg Village is that it is located in about 1 km from Gulmarg Gondola. You will have to walk or take a taxi to the Gulmarg Gondola in the morning. Some people might find that unpleasant while others may enjoy the walk.

Sometimes, it can get a bit busy with traffic and local tourists asking to take pictures with you and your ski gear.

You can also jump on the back of a taxi on the way to the gondola — the best way to wake up and get ready for a wicked day of powder at Gulmarg Ski Resort! It's all part of your Ski Himalaya adventure.
