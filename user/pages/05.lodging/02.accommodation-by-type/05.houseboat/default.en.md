#Staying on a Houseboat on Dal Lake in Srinagar

Dal Lake in Srinagar, nicknamed the "Jewel in the crown of Kashmir" is known for its famous houseboats. In Srinagar, you can see thousands of stationary houseboats -- usually anchored along the edges of the Dal and Nageen Lakes and the Jhelum River.

##Dal Lake Houseboat, Srinagar - A unique experience.

Made of local cedar wood, the houseboats are beautifully decorated with intricate carved wood paneling and come in all different sizes – typically with a living room, kitchen, and up to 3 bedrooms and bathrooms. Some of these beautiful boats date back to the early 1900s and can be rented out by tourists. All houseboats have balconies so guests can sit outside in the sun and enjoy the scenery.

Just like hotels, the houseboats vary in degree of luxury and location. All houseboats, regardless of category, have a "houseboy" for each boat and offer personalized service.

Houseboats not anchored to the shore have shikaras to ferry guests to the nearest jetty.

Houseboats are a unique experience to live on the water and experience Srinagar's charm. It's a great add-on to your Ski Himalaya vacation. If you want to take a break for a few days from skiing at Gulmarg Ski Resort, you'll want to consider staying on a houseboat – a floating Srinagar Hotel.
