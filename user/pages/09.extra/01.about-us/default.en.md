Our love for skiing started when we were young kids back in Quebec, Canada. Once we were old enough to travel, we made our first trip to the Rocky Mountains of Utah — about 4,000 kilometers from home. Eventually, we moved to Banff in the Canadian Rockies and later to Whistler Blackcomb.

Our passion for skiing led us to places like New Zealand and Argentina where we could ski in the summertime. That's where the idea of a ski adventure company started to develop in our minds. The snow quality is pretty poor in the Southern Hemisphere so our exploration continued to Japan where the snow is excellent, and the mountains are steep. That was in 2007. While we were in Japan, we heard about Gulmarg in India and its legendary snow – a vast ski area with a small amount of skiers but big on culture. Wow…this is what we were looking for.

In January 2008, we arrived in Gulmarg, a remote village in the beautiful Himalayan Mountains located in the Kashmir region of India. The folks in Japan weren't lying. We spent 42 days in Gulmarg that season, and 30 of the 42 days were "exceptional." During out first two weeks in Gulmarg, we had fresh, deep lines every day.

Friends begged us to return to Canada and spend a season at a new ski resort in British Columbia called Revelstoke. But Gulmarg was calling us back. We arrived earlier for the 2008-2009 season. On the first day of 2009, we were greeted with blue skies, fresh snow, and deep lines. The Himalayas became our home for the winter…and that's how Skigulmarg.com was born.
