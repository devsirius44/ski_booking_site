### When is the best time to ski Gulmarg?###

I would say that the best time to come ski Gulmarg is between the last week of January and the last week of February.

The resort normally accept riders from Jan 1st to March 31st.

Sometime early January and March can be excellent. We never know what Mother Nature will bring us. 

I hope this help. Contact us if you have any question. Happy Riding and see you in Gulmarg.
