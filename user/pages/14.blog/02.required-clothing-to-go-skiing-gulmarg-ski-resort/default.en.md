#### 1. Skis

There are many types of skis, a powder ski being wider for more floatability. Others include freeriding skis, all-mountain (rocker) skis, backcountry skis, and carver skis. You should go for a carving ski if you&#39;re a beginner.

When choosing a ski, remember to look for the length, dimensions, turn radius, bindings and manoeuvrability. Bindings are bought separately.

Some people don&#39;t feel the need for helmets at all. This is not a mandatory piece of gear; however, they can protect your head from serious injuries. They are available for rent in Gulmarg Ski resort, so you don&#39;t have to buy one right away. Wear a [warm hat or beanie](https://www.decathlon.in/ski-clothing-accessories/hats-beanies-and-headbands-10928) if you&#39;re not going to use helmets or with the helmet.

#### 3. Goggles

Goggles are made to protect your vision and eyes from harmful UV rays. The weather in the mountains can quickly change, and the sun is treacherous at times. A goggle will protect you from harmful sun rays, wind, and snow.

There are many factors to consider while [buying ski goggles](https://www.decathlon.in/protection-and-accessories/ski-snowboard-goggles-5203), such as lenses, comfort, and breathability. Make sure you choose your goggles as per your preferences to have the best skiing experience in Gulmarg. Pink lenses are best when the weather is somewhat cloudy, clear lenses on very cloudy days, and darker lenses work best on sunny days.

#### 4. Gloves or mittens

Whether you&#39;re a first-time skier or an advanced one, gloves or mittens are a necessary piece of ski clothing. You don&#39;t want to freeze your fingers from the mountain winds. There are varieties of gloves available in the market, and you can [buy ski gloves](https://www.decathlon.in/ski-clothing-accessories/gloves-and-mittens-5007https://www.decathlon.in/ski-clothing-accessories/gloves-and-mittens-5007) or mittens that fit your needs or preferences, but it&#39;s always a good idea to invest in a good-quality glove or mittens.

#### 5. Poles

Ski poles are no different than trekking poles — they are used to maintain balance, support, and accuracy while skiing. It can help you from falling and getting injured.

#### 6. Ski / snowboard boots, winter boots (or Gumboots)

You might find winter boots, Gumboots, and ski boots interchangeably used in Gulmarg Ski resort but know that they&#39;re different.

Winter boots, Gumboots are generally made of rubber, hence also called rubber boots. You&#39;ll need these boots if you&#39;re planning to stroll in the snow and explore the views.

#### 7. Thermals (Base Layer)

Thermals are the piece of clothing that is worn first on your body. Their main aim is to keep you dry and warm. They usually have tops and pants for the upper and lower parts of the body, but you can also buy them in one piece.

The biggest concern you need to have for thermals is that they fit nicely on your body. As they can cause discomfort, uneasiness and frustration otherwise. We recommend not wearing cotton as a first layer. Wool or synthetic fabric are best. You can easily [buy ski thermals in India for men](https://www.decathlon.in/men-ski-clothing/men-thermals-10883) and [women](https://www.decathlon.in/women-ski-clothing/women-thermals-10943) online.

#### 8. Jacket or Coat

A ski jacket or coat will provide you with insulation and keep the icy weather of Gulmarg at bay. Whether you&#39;re a [beginner skier](http://www.natgeotraveller.in/a-ski-guide-to-gulmarg/) or a regular one, a jacket is another ski clothing you can&#39;t do without to enjoy skiing in Gulmarg ski resort.

#### 9. Pants

Ski pants, as you can guess, protect your lower body. They&#39;re made of insulated waterproof materials, designed to keep you warm and dry in the freezing cold. Waterproofing, pockets, venting, and warmth are some of the key features to look for while buying ski pants.

Make sure you pack your ski pants along with other ski clothing and equipment because winter isn&#39;t going to be easy on you!

#### 10. Neck Warmers

Okay, probably not the most sought after ski clothing for Indians, but when you&#39;re coming to Gulmarg, we&#39;d advise [buying a neck warmer](https://www.decathlon.in/ski-clothing-accessories/neck-warmers-10931). They can be a simple scarf or a balaclava, but they&#39;re going to protect you from chilly winds while you ski on the silky snow!

Winds can quickly get into your jackets and thermals from your neck and may leave you feeling cold. However, if you&#39;re sure you are ready to ski without a neck warmer, don&#39;t blame us for anything later ;)

#### 11. Socks

A good pair of ski boots should be complemented with a good pair of ski socks. They are not a necessary piece of ski clothing, and you can wear regular woollen socks for skiing in Gulmarg. However, ski socks will make your skiing experience far better since they&#39;re designed for this specific purpose. Ski socks keep your feet dry and warm while providing cushioning and comfort.

Winters are dry in Gulmarg, and on top of that, the sun is bright. You&#39;re likely to develop lips crack, dry skin and soak harmful UV rays unless you invest in sunscreen and lip balm with SPF.
