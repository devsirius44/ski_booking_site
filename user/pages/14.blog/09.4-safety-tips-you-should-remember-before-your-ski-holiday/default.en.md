## 4 safety tips you should remember before your ski holiday

Skiing holidays are cold, yes, but super fun too! 

Days spent careering down the slopes, warming up with a hot chocolate at the top of the mountain, or hitting the bars after a long day in the sun are days well spent. There’s nothing quite like it.

If you’re looking to book a ski holiday, whether it’s with the family or a group of friends, there are a few safety tips to get accustomed to first. 

I’ve rounded up the top four as a starting point:

### Don’t get carried away with alcohol
Yes, Après ski is fun, and although it may be incredibly tempting to hit the bars and sink several Jager bombs along with everyone else, remember [if you're heading to the slope](https://outsider.ie/travel/skiing-essential-tips/ "Skiing Gulmarg, Himalayas - Don't drink too much") after, don’t overdo it! 

Drunk skiing is absolutely not recommended, and can cause serious accidents. If you’re with a group of friends, it’s likely alcohol will be a part of the trip, but limit yourself in the day, and make sure you’re fully hydrated and recovered before skiing or snowboarding the day after a night out. 

The last thing you’d want is to injure others (or more likely, yourself) just for the sake of a few drinks, it’s just not worth it.

### Obey the highway code

The [snowsports highway code](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/how-to-stay-safe-on-the-slopes/ "Ski the Himalayas - Follow the rules"), that is. 

The International Ski Federation outlines ten ski and snowboarding rules which those on the slopes must abide by, the same as the highway code applies to all drivers. These include respecting others, speed, overtaking, the possibility of avalanches, and choice of route.

Familiarise yourself with these and you won’t regret it (and more importantly, you won’t put anyone’s safety at risk either).

### Invest in quality ski wear

Not just that, but equipment, too. This is one of the most important things to remember if you’re planning a skiing holiday – and despite popular opinion, it doesn’t always have to break the bank.

Helmets are probably the most vital part of any skiing outfit; if you were to crash, your head needs to be protected above all else. For instance, did you know that [two out of every three skiers who crashed but came out off injury-free](http://www.holidaysafe.co.uk/winter-sports-travel-insurance/cost-of-injury-skiing-infographic/ "Skiing in India - Wear a helmet") said it was due to wearing a helmet at the time? Investing in quality ski wear will also keep you warm during the day in those sub-zero temperatures. Pack your sun cream too, as the possibility of getting sunburn up there is heavily increased, plus you don’t want white goggle-marks!

### Know your ability

And stick to it, too! If you’re a first-time skier, it’s fine to take it easy when getting to know everything, and don’t rush to get to more advanced slopes. 

One thing that’s also important is to never lie about your ability, either, it’ll just put you and others at risk, and will impact your whole skiing experience. There’s no shame in admitting you’re a beginner – just take your time and learn as you go, you’ll be a seasoned skier in no time!
