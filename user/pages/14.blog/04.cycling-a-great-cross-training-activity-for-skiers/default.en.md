I don’t know about you but one thing that really makes me smile and feel alive is to play outside. While I am totally passionate about skiing and snow, I also really enjoy cycling, downhill, enduro and bicycle touring.

The question is: Is cycling a great cross-training activity for skiers and snowboarders to stay fit for the ski season?

We will have a look at both road cycling and mountain biking (which I both enjoy). We will compare what muscle groups are used when cycling and when skiing. 

### Road Cycling - As a great Cross-Training Activities for Skiers
Let’s start by looking at the most used muscle group used when skiing. Based one both these sites (<a href="https://www.mountainwarehouse.com/expert-advice/ski-fitness-muscles-that-matter" target="_blank">Mountain Warehouse</a> & <a href="https://newtoski.com/primary-muscles-used-for-skiing/" target="_blank">New to Ski</a>), here is a list of the main muscle group used when skiing.

#### Main Muscle Groups Used When Skiing
* Quadriceps
* Hamstrings
* Gluts
* Back (particularly your lats)
* Obliques (internal & external)
* Arms (Biceps & Triceps)

Based one both these sites (<a href="https://billbonebikelaw.com/news-from-the-road/muscle-groups-targeted-cycling/" target="_blank">Bill Bone Bike Law</a> & <a href="https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/the-primary-muscles-used-for-cycling-and-how-to-train-them/" target="_blank">Training Peak</a>) here is a list of the main muscle group used when cycling.

#### Main Muscle Groups Used When Cycling
* Calves
* Quadriceps
* Hamstrings
* Glutes
* Shoulders (Deltoids)
* Foot (Plantar flexors, and dorsiflexors)
* Arms (Biceps & Triceps)

As we can see, both skiing and road cycling use very similar muscle groups. Let’s now have a look at the muscle group used when mountain biking. 

### Mountain Biking - As a great Cross-Training Activities for Skiers

Based one both these sites (<a href="https://stretchcoach.com/articles/stretches-for-mountain-biking/" target="_blank">StretchCoach</a> & <a href="https://bestsportslounge.com/mountain-biking-muscles" target="_blank">BestSportsLounge</a>) here is a list of the main muscle group used when mountain biking.

#### Main Muscle Groups Used When Mountain Biking
* Calve
* Quadriceps
* Hamstrings
* Glutes
* Shoulders (Deltoids)
* Lower & upper abdominal
* Arms (Biceps & Triceps)
* Obliques
* Lower back
   
Both skiing and mountain biking use very similar muscle groups. 

A post on the <a href="https://www.skimag.com/.amp/ski-performance/5-cross-training-activities-for-skiers" target="_blank">Skimag</a> site adds one more important point, “By cycling in the off-season, you develop not only the strength to ski your best, but the endurance to shred from bell to bell. ”

### Bicycle Touring - Travelling to Cycle and Cross-Train for Skiing during the ski off-season.

Who does not like to travel to enjoy their favourite sport or passion? I know I do and as a ski tour operator, all our clients like to travel to play in the snow.

I take it that you are probably like me. Just laying on the beach and roasting is the sun is not your cup of tea. When planning a trip for the winter off-season, have you considered cycling? 

Bicycle touring is a great way to be active, discover a new country and cross-train while travelling. I recommend Taiwan.

As mentioned on <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/taiwan-cycle-tour/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a> “Cycle Route No. 1 -- a two-wheeled circumnavigation around the island of Taiwan -- is not to be taken lightly. Inaugurated in 2015, this 602-mile (968-kilometre) epic is fast becoming one of Asia's greatest destinations”

As I live in Taiwan, me, Yanik,  founder of <a href="https://skigulmarg.com" target="_blank">Skigulmarg.com</a>, in partnership with my Taiwanese girlfriend, we created a new website: <a href="https://taiwan-cycling-tour.com" target="_blank">Taiwan-cycling-tour.com</a>.
