The video above gives a few funny tips on how to be a skier. But being a skier is a lot more than simply putting on the boots and sliding down a snowy hill. Skiing is a lifestyle, a culture, a creed. And you need to learn the attitude aswell as the skills. Luckily we´re here to help you with some of the basics.

Since Skiing became such a huge cultural thing it is no wonder that a particular language developed around it. Here are some of the most commonly used words and phrases in the world of skiing and their meaning, so next time you come skiing in Gulmarg you won't have to feel left out of the conversation.

**Après-ski** – This is the relax period that comes after a good day of skiing, people can drink, eat or even dance if they still have energy, but usually it is all about drinking and sharing the experiences of the day..

**Backcountry/Slackcountry** – Unregulated terrain outside of the resort main areas, people usually have to climb or ride vehicles other than official gondolas to access it, as a result they are usually untouched and fresh, but they can also be more dangerous..

**Bombing** – Skiing in a reckless manner than can be a risk to others or yourself. Avoid at all times.

**Face-Plant** – A common activity for beginners, it means falling over and planting your face in the snow.

**Face Shot** – When the snow is so loose that skiing makes it spray over your face.

**Heli skiing** – The next level of backcountry skiing, using a helicopter to reach high inaccessible areas and enjoying fresher snow and better views.

**Chalet** – A chalet, also called Swiss chalet, is a type of building, typical of the European Alpine region. It is often made of wood, with a heavy, gently sloping roof and wide, well-supported eaves set at right angles to the front of the house.

**Off-Piste** – Similar to backcountry, this refers to going outside of regulated slopes to avoid crowds and have a more raw and exciting experience.

**Powder** – Fresh snow that hasn't been packed, groomed or touched by other skiers, usually found in backcountry skiing or snowboarding.

**Powder Hound** – A hardcore skier addicted to “powder” preferring off piste skiing rather than traditional slopes.

**Pow Pow** – Slang for powder or snow used casually.

**Ski Bum** – The skiing equivalent of a backpacker, a person who only wants to ski all the time, spending little money and maximizing time out in the snow.

**Slope** – Part of a ski resort groomed and prepared for skiing, usually divided by danger or experience level.

Remember these and you´ll be on your way to talking like a true Powderhound. If you want to learn some more as well as intonation tips, take a look at this funny video.
