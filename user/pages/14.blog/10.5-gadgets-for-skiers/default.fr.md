## Cameras

Being able to enjoy a day skiing and building memories to be shared later is amazing, and being capable of appreciating the beauty of a snow covered mountain in the moment without worries is the best feeling ever. But let's be serious what good is killing it out there in the snow if there is no one to see it. Drones allow for birds eye views of your trip, but head mounted cameras allow for a more “up, close and personal” perspective. GoPro still dominates this market,  but which go pro is the best? we choose the **<a href="https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Silver-Waterproof-MicroSDHC-Flexible/dp/B07J5MB3Y3/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=hero+7&qid=1549647005&s=Electronics&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1" target="_blank">GoPro Hero 7</a>**, being affordable, ultra durable and having a lot of accessories available to help you in filming great videos on the go.

## Touch screen gloves

Now that we mentioned smartwatches, they all come with capacitive touchscreens nowadays, and that requires using fingertips in order to use them, which in turn means having to take off and put on your gloves every time you want to check messages, start a countdown or see your vitals. Or it would be, were it not for Ski Gloves with touch screen fingertips, that allow you to use any touch device without having to expose your hand to the cold weather. Our pick in this category is the **<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Andorra-Country-Textured-Touchscreen-Zippered/dp/B072ZYY87D?tag=extremepedia-20&th=1&psc=1" target="_blank">Andorra Men's C-100</a>**, they are modern and stylish, with additional functionality, very warm and really cheap.

## Headphones

While it may be tempting to get some wireless or bluetooth connected earbuds, we wholeheartedly recommend using wired ones, just so if they slip out during a particularly rough turn they can remain safely tethered to you via the wires. Our pick are the **<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0117RFZHC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=whptable-20&linkId=8a568357dd370406134dd17a48c9f4f8&language=en_US&th=1" target="_blank"> Bose Soundsport</a>** headphones, they have good wire length, excellent sound quality, ear clips for better adjustment and big controls for easy use when wearing gloves, plus they can come optimized for Samsung or Apple devices, and are highly customizable thanks to their many ear holders included in every package, no matter what your ear looks like, they will fit.
