### **Smoothies**
Given the effects of altitude on the human body, eating heavy foods isn't the way to go, smoothies are a great way to pump a lot of calories into the body that are easy to absorb since liquids are easier to digest.

### **Hi-energy Snack Bars**
Skiing is an intense activity that consumes a lot of energy, having a big breakfast is important, but once out in the mountain, having energy bars at the ready is ideal. Just take 2 of your favorite brand and flavour to eat between runs and make sure the bars contain at least 250 calories. For even better results you can try making your own as you can see **<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMJEIiWV3VQ" target="_blank"> in this video.</a>**

### **Iron Rich Foods**
Iron allows better oxygenation of muscle and tissues, making it essential in the oxygen light environment of most ski resorts. Legumes, beans and greens are the ideal candidates, with greens like spinach and kale being the best choice given their high nutritional value and lightness.

### **BONUS TIP!**
**Temperature in ski resorts can be awfully low and while skiers are covered by thermal underwear, jackets and pants, food doesn't enjoy the same level of protection, taking a thermal container with you can help keep liquids and food from freezing. Nothing worse than going to take a sip or a bite and being met with a block of ice.**
