Skiing in the Himalayas or any other backcountry terrain carries a high risk of injury, this makes it paramount to know the best tips on prevention and how to recover from skiing injuries. I am prety sure visiting a hospital when skiing Gulmarg is not on your bucket list.

## **PREVENTION**

The best way to recover from injuries is to never get one in the first place, be sure to obey these basic principles of prevention.

**Maintain Good Fitness**

* Remain active and with good fitness. A trained body is less prone to injury, take a look at our <a href="https://skigulmarg.com/blog/gym-routine-for-skiers" target="_blank">sample routine</a> as a starting point.

**Know your limits**

* Do a <a href="https://www.elementconcept.com/warm-ups-and-injury-prevention/" target="_blank">dynamic stretch</a> before starting to ski, and stop skiing before exhaustion sets in. 
 
* Skiing or snowboarding when tired makes people prone to accidents as they become sluggish and start compromising form.

**Use the right equipment**

* Buying your equipment and maintaining it constantly is the best way to go. But if skiing in Gulmarg you can always <a href="https://skigulmarg.com/deals-and-packages/rental" target="_blank">rent everything</a> you need.

**Learn how to use the lift**

* Believe it or not, 75% of skiing injuries don't happen on the slopes! instead, they occur on the lifts either from falling, tumbling or getting tangled.

* Using the lift goes beyond knowing how to get on and off, but also being attentive and on the lookout for accidents, obstacles or other issues.

## **INJURIES & RECOVERY** 

No matter the type of injury, follow this general advice to make the recovery go smoothly:

* **Seek medical attention:** no matter if it´s just a torn muscle or a grave fracture, never leave the injury to just heal by itself.

* **Get enough rest:** We know it´s hard to remain inactive for long periods of time, but failing to respect the recovery downtime makes it harder to heal and increases the risk of more injuries.

* **Take your pills:** Be sure to take any prescribed medication, natural remedies may be appealing but will never be as good as proper medicine.

* **Don´t delay surgeries:** In cases like torn ligaments and meniscus, surgery may be needed to correct the issue. Do them ASAP to avoid worsening the injury.

* **Physical Therapy:** Injuries will leave the body weakened and fractures will surely cause imbalances. Doing physical therapy can help solve these issues by means of directed exercise and rehabilitation.

* **Take it easy:** When coming back to the slopes for skiing, snowboarding or just trekking remember to take it easy and give the body enough time to readjust to high levels of activity.
