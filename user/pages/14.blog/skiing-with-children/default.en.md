# Skiing with children

Being able to see your young ones in the snow, accompanying you in your hobby is one of the most fulfilling experiences for a powderhound father. But it is important to keep some things in mind so the experience can also be good for them. First of all...

## Pick the right age

There are many proven advantages to starting early on any sport or discipline. This includes learning an instrument, practicing martial arts and; of course; skiing. When children are young their brains are still malleable and ready to learn, like a dry sponge ready to absorb everything that is taught to them.

But before you book a trip and come skiing in Gulmarg with your children be conscious of a certain fact; there is something as being too young. Children below 4 years usually lack the basic motor and cognitive skills needed to start skiing. It is not a matter of whether they can walk well and without falling, is a matter of focus and coordination. Young children will usually be overloaded when skiing for the first time. They will have to try on new clothes, attach the skis to their tiny and usually unencumbered feet and follow directions while remaining interested in a single activity for long stretches of time, all of which make it difficult for a young boy or girl to learn, let alone enjoy the sport.

So, before you come skiing in Gulmarg or anywhere, ask yourself: Is my child old enough to ski with me? if younger than 4 years we don't recommend it. It's much better to book different activities for them, like pony and sledge rides.

## Rent the gear instead of buying

Ski gear is not cheap, at least not the good one. An adult can expect to shell out around 2000$ for ski gear, from skis and poles to gps and down jackets with prices for children not being much lower than that. The good and bad thing with children is that they are always growing, on the good side this means that their progress will be much easier to see and follow, but on the bad side it means that those 2000$ worth of gear are probably not even going to last a year.

As children age they will surely outgrow their pants and jackets, boots and bindings will be too small for their feet and even gloves will be too snug for their hands. So the best thing t do for them is to rent their gear, that way you will never have to worry about obsolete equipment that will have to be thrown out, re sold or kept forever cluttering the house.

When skiing in Gulmarg you can always rent equipment for you and your children, we can take care of everything you need. Another idea would be to keep having children so they can reuse their older sibling´s gear; but that doesn't quite work for saving money, does it?, hahaha.

## Don't underestimate instruction

Before you were the avid powderhound that you are today there was a time when you didn't even know how to strap your own boots. That's probably the world where your child is living today and it's up to you to introduce them to the world of pow pow… or is it?. While having parents that ski can be an advantage for a young learner and you can certainly teach them all tricks you already know; it is never a bad idea to have a professional guide them on their first step into the snow.

A professional ski instructor will be able to ascertain the skills of your child and follow the best path for them. They will be completely devoted to teaching. They will have patience and knowledge and they won't feel bad about having to stay on the bunny slopes while you shred pow on the big boy course. If you don't want your child wasting precious skiing time by doing some boring learning then maybe consider booking some lessons at a skiing school before coming. We have a lot of faith in the <a href="https://www.supremeski.com/france/val-thorens-ski-schools" target="blank">Supreme Ski school in Val Thorens</a>. They have been teaching children and adults for 3 decades and really know their trade. But of course you may choose any reputable skiing school closest to you.

## Plan your vacation sites for convenience

Considering all the additional steps and considerations that you will need to take while skiing with children, the thing you will definitely want to avoid is having to ride for hours just to get to the right piste. Booking a hotel near the beginner slopes of your resort is paramount so you can ski right out of the lobby and ski back in once your child is tired and ready for a nap.

In Gulmarg be sure to book a stay at the Highlands Park hotel, it is one of our most comfortable options and has the beginner slopes right outside, while being relatively close to the gondola for when your “me time” comes around.
