## WORLD FAMOUS HELI SKIING - Gulmarg, Himalayas, India

### What is Heli Skiing?

Simply put, Heli skiing is the use of Helicopters to reach spots on a mountain or resort that would be inaccessible on foot and then skiing down.

But there is a lot more to it than simply going up and down. Instead of going up the mountain with a regular gondola, slowly and up to a certain point, ride a helicopter up to the highest point in the mountain, then ride down pristine slopes with no one to stop you, like James Bond infiltrating a secluded evil lair!

### The Origins of Heliski

Heli skiing was invented in Canada when Hans Gmoser; mountaineers and film makers decided to use aircraft to carry clients all the way up the mountains with the activity quickly earning popularity and expanding to resorts worldwide.

At first resorts used biplanes and old helicopters but nowadays modern helicopters are used worldwide!
