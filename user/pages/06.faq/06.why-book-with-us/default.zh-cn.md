        <h4 class="ac-title" id="six">Why Book with Skigulmarg.com?</h4>
        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>
                I've spent the last 7 winters in Gulmarg and have lots of local knowledge. When you book a tour package with Skigulmarg.com, you are not calling someone who lives miles away from Gulmarg.  We live here all winter — we ski here; we know the mountain, the hotels, the restaurants, and the locals.  For more reasons why you should book a tour package with Skigulmarg.com, see our <a href="/deals-and-packages/why-book-with-us" title="Go to: Why Book with Us">why book with us</a> page.
