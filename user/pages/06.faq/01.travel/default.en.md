        <h4 class="ac-title" id="one">Where is Gulmarg? Once I arrive in India, how do I get to Gulmarg and how long does it take?</h4>
        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>
                Gulmarg is a small village located in the Northern part of India, in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.  It's located in the Pir Panjal peaks in the Western edge of the Himalayan Mountains. The nearest city is Srinagar (52 kilometers from Gulmarg), which is Kashmir's state capital.
            </p>
            <p>
                International travelers will most likely fly into Delhi, India and then take a flight to Srinagar (there are several land options available too). From Srinagar, you can take a taxi to Gulmarg.  Approximate travel time (by air) from Delhi to Gulmarg is about 5 hours including flight and taxi to Gulmarg.

        <h4 class="ac-title" id="two">Do I need a Visa to travel to India and Kashmir? What other travel documents do I require?</h4>
        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>
                All foreigners traveling to India and Kashmir must possess a valid national passport (which must be valid for at least 6 months) and obtain a Visa for India. See our India Formalities page for complete details.

        <h4 class="ac-title" id="three">Are the roads safe in India?</h4>
        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>
                The road from Srinagar to Gulmarg is paved. During the winter months (and especially after a snowstorm), the roads in higher elevations (from Srinagar to Gulmarg) can be icy. However, road conditions have improved over the years, and there are more snowplows available to clear the roads quicker. All our taxi drivers carry chains for the last 12 kilometers.

        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>
                The larger and nicer hotels, Kashmir heliski and Kashmir Alpine Rental Shop accept Credit Cards. India is a cash-oriented country. You will need to pay cash for lift tickets, food, and drinks in most places. Your hotel might agree to run a tab for all your meals and purchases and then allow you to pay at the end of your stay with a Credit Card. I say, "Get as much cash as you can before you get to Gulmarg!"

        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>
                I have used Traveler's Checks all over the world but never in Gulmarg. I also never heard of anybody using Traveler's Checks in Gulmarg. It may be possible to use them, but I would try other options.

        <h4 class="ac-title" id="seven">Are there ATM machines in Gulmarg?</h4>
        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>
                Yes, but they are not always reliable and do not always accept debit cards. See our <a href="/gulmarg-ski-resort/about-gulmarg/accommodation-map" title="Gulmarg Village Map">village map</a> for the Bank Location. We recommend getting as much cash as you can before you arrive in Gulmarg. It is possible to get Rupees in your home country; you can also change money or use an ATM Machine at the Delhi Airport, in Delhi, and in Srinagar. There is also an ATM Machine in Tangmarg, which is 12 km from Gulmarg.

        <h4 class="ac-title" id="eight">Where can I exchange my money into local currency in Gulmarg?</h4>
        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>
                Now that Gulmarg has a Bank, you can exchange foreign currencies in rupees. Other than at the bank, there are little or no places to exchange your money once you are in Gulmarg. It's best to exchange your money when you arrive in India at a bank in the airport. Make sure you ask for small denominations like R100 Notes as you will need them for small purchases, and it may be hard to get change in Gulmarg. See our <a href="/gulmarg-ski-resort/about-gulmarg/accommodation-map" title="Gulmarg Village Map">village map</a> for the Bank Location.

                The official language is Urdu, but the main languages spoken are Kashmiri and Dogri. Hindu is spoken as a second language. English is widely spoken too.

        <h4 class="ac-title" id="eleven">Should I get travel insurance?</h4>
        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>
                Yes, travel insurance is mandatory for your trip to Gulmarg. There has been political unrest in Kashmir (which has subsided over the past decade), and Gulmarg Ski Resort is basically a backcountry ski resort that is not controlled. For these reasons, travel insurance is mandatory. See our <a href="/gulmarg-ski-resort/getting-here/travel-insurance" title="Go to: Travel Insurance">travel insurance</a> page for more info.

        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>
                Most major airlines (Air India, Jet Airways, and Virgin Atlantic) have a free baggage allowance of 2 pieces of luggage that must not exceed 158 cm (62 inches) or 20 to 23 kilograms (50 pounds). Please be sure to always double check your airline carrier's website for up-to-date information.

        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>

        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>
                We recommend that you place the following items in your checked baggage rather than your carry-on luggage: Cameras, video cameras, walkie talkies, batteries, and any type of safety equipment (transceivers, shovels, and probes). It will make things go smoother when they check your bags.

        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>
                Most of the nicer hotels will have telephone, TV, radio, and laundry services, but don't expect flat screen TVs or personal Internet connection in your room. One new hotel, Khyber Mountain Resort &amp; Spa, will have a gym, indoor pool, and a spa.

        <h4 class="ac-title" id="sixteen">What is the voltage in Gulmarg? Should I bring a converter and an adapter?</h4>
        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>
                India is 110 volts with an English type of plug. It might be a good idea to bring a converter and an adapter with a fuse to prevent problems with your expensive electronics as there could be a power surge. After coming back from India, I had to get a new power pack for my Macbook. I always buy a multi-plug extension cord when I go to Srinagar or Tangmarg.

        <div class="ac-content">
            <p>
                As of 2011, all of Gulmarg has WiFi service – making it India's highest WiFi zone! But don't forget: it is still India… It will work sometimes… Most hotels offer WiFi but it is slow (as all guests are sharing the same slow connection) and unreliable.
